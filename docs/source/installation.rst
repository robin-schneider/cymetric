Installation
------------

We recommend using `conda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/index.html>`_.
Create a new environment with

.. code-block:: bash

    conda create -n cymetric

Then install with pip    

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install git+https://github.com/robin-schneider/cymetric.git

for the latest version. There will also be (stable) releases on pypi,
so you can also try

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install cymetric
